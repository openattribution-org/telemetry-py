OpenAttribution Telemetry Schema v0.5

This module defines the core data types for the OpenAttribution standard.
OpenAttribution is an open specification for tracking content attribution
in AI agent interactions.

The schema supports:
- Session-based event tracking
- Privacy-tiered conversation capture
- Content retrieval and citation tracking
- Commerce/conversion attribution
- Cross-session journey attribution
- AIMS manifest integration for licensing verification

Content events track the lifecycle of content through an agent interaction.
Conversation events capture the query/response flow with privacy controls.
Commerce events enable attribution for e-commerce conversions.

the signal emitter and consumer.
